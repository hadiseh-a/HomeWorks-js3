/*
  Build a guessing game:

  - The system is picking a random number from 1 to 6.
  - A user can enter a number. (You can use prompt or input or ...)
  - If the user's number is equal to a random number, give the user 2 points.
  - If the user's number is different than the random number by 1, give the user 1 point. Otherwise, give the user 0 points.
  - The user can play the game as long as they want to.
  - Note: you should use "Promise" to resolve this question. For example, you can create promise for check the input number.

/*
  todo1: what is the difference between an asynchronous function and a synchronous function?
*/

// ! Answer

//Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. Tasks can run simultaneously. Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation depends on completing the one before it. Each task requires an answer before moving on to the next iteration.
